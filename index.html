										<p>Bug Bounty is an application designed for business level and development level users to report and track bugs on the different internal applications we use within Revature. Bug Bounty is unique in that it provides gamification of the bug fixing process through a score associated with resolving bugs. This will allow for more inherent competitiveness throughout the process or bug fixing across Revature's suite of enterprise level applications.</p>

							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
							<p>Before discovering my love for software development, I was a manager of a home services company in the Seattle area while I completed my Bachelors in Mathematics from Central Washington University. Upon moving to Houston, I was researching ways to use my degree and that lead me to software development. I immediately fell in love. Waking up early and staying up late to learn new technologies and produce the best projects I am capable of making has become my life. </p>
							<br />
							<p>My goal now is to find a new position as a full stack developer that allows me to continue learning, improving my knowledge and skills everyday, and meaningfully contributing to projects. If you believe I would be a valuable member of your team, please reach out to me and have a great day.</p>
